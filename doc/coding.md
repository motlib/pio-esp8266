# Coding Guideline

This document contains some notes and remarks about the coding style applied in
this project.

## Commenting

Comments fulfill two main goals: 

* Explain how to use the code. Many parts / components of the project might be
  re-used in other projects, so they have to be documented in a way that
  explains their use, their interfaces and the contraints to observe.
  
* Explain the internal implementation of components. This helps other developers
  to be able to understand the internal functionality, e.g. when extending the
  components.
